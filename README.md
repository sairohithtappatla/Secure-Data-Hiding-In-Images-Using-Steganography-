## 🧑‍💻 **Usage**

### **Encrypting an Image 🔒**

1. **Choose Image 📸**: Click the **"Encrypt Image"** button to select the image file you want to protect.
2. **Enter Password 🔑**: Type a **secure password** into the password field.
3. **Encrypt Image 🔒**: Click **"Encrypt Image"**. The encrypted image will be saved as a `.bin` file.

### **Decrypting an Image 🔓**

1. **Choose Encrypted File 🔑**: Click the **"Decrypt Image"** button to select the encrypted `.bin` file.
2. **Enter Password 🔑**: Enter the same **password** used during encryption.
3. **Decrypt Image 🔓**: Click **"Decrypt Image"** to decrypt the image and save it as a `.png` file.

## 📝 **Example Workflow**

Here’s a quick look at how it works:

### **1. Encrypting**
1. Select `image.jpg`
2. Enter password: `mysecretpassword`
3. Encrypted file: `image_encrypted.bin`

### **2. Decrypting**
1. Select `image_encrypted.bin`
2. Enter the same password: `mysecretpassword`
3. Decrypted file: `image_decrypted.png`

You now have your **encrypted** and **decrypted** images! 🎉

## 🔐 **Security Considerations**

- **Password Strength 💪**: Always use a **strong and unique password**. Weak passwords make your images vulnerable.
- **Salt 🔑**: This app uses a fixed salt value for encryption. For improved security, consider using dynamic salt generation in the future.
